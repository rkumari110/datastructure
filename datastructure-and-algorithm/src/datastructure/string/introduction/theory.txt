String in Java is represented by array of characters. 
So, the question is when we already have character array in java then what is the need to
have a special datastructure String. The reason is that string has limited set of 
elements which makes its special and makes string manipulation easier.


How Java stores character ?

There are 128 ASCII values which are used to represent the characters.
Java uses uft-16 to store characters and each character takes 16 bits.
First 128 characters of ASCII are same as that of UTF-16.

Different ways to create String in Java :

1. Character Array :
char [] string1 = {'j', 'a', 'v', 'a'};

2. Using String : Immutable 

String string2 = "java";

String string3 = new String("java");

3. Using StringBuffer : mutable and synchronized.

StringBuffer string = new StringBuffer("java");

4. Using StringBuilder : mutable and not-synchronized.

StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder("java");
