String in Java is represented by array of characters. 
So, the question is when we already have character array in java then what is the need to
have s apecial datastructure String. The reason is that string has limited set of 
elements which makes its special.

There are 128 ASCII values which are used to represent the characters.

Java uses uft-16 to store characters and each character takes 16 bits.
First 128 characters of ASCII are same as that of UTF-16.
