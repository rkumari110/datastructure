Give a string check if it is a plindrome or not.

Ex : 
I/P : ABCDCBA
O/P : TRUE

I/P : ABCD
O/P : FALSE

Solution Approach :

1. Naive Apprroach : 

Step 1 : Take the string
Step 2: Reverse the string and store it in a different variable
Step 3: compare the original string with the new one. 

Analysis of the solution :

to type theta: alt + 233(num keys)
This solution takes Θ(n) time to reverse the string and Θ(n) space to store the reversed string.


2.Efficient solution

step 1: take two pointer to donate start and end of the string. 
step 2: Increment the start pointer and decrement the end pointer until eithe the characters at the pointers do not match or till the 
end pointers ie less that start pointer. 

Analysis of the solution :
This solution will take Θ(n) time to traverse the string and it will need Θ(1) auxiliary space.
